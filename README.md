# Indian Premier League 2022 Data Analysis
## Here, I have been considered Powerplay Stats mainly from IPL 2022 data for each match. 
#### Data consists of Team1, Team2, Powerplay Runs team1, Powerplay Wickets team1, Powerplay Runs Team2, Powerplay Wickets Team2, Toss Decision, Toss Winner, Winner, Player of the Match, Venue, City, etc. 
#### Few of these fields aren't necessary. I have considered those are relevant to Analyze. 
#### These stats and analysis are jsut a part of the problem. With ball by ball data available for IPL. We can still drill down the data to get more specific stats teamwise. 
#### I have written a blog on Medium as well. Please look into it.
